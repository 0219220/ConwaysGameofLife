I think that the idea of evolution being simulated this way is interesting from the point of view of a curious person such as myself.
I like the idea of seeing how a civilization evolves from each frame, much like the Freezer episode of Death, Love and Robots.
Although, I must say this. I'm currently reading Cosmos by Carl Sagan and a phrase that really stuck with me goes something along the lines of
"If the Earth were to be recreated a million times under the same conditions, we wouldn't end up with life as we know it today". I'm probably
skewering it, but it is something like that. What I'm trying to say is this: Life and evolution isn't deterministic. And even though this 
simulation is, I like the idea of seeing life evolve.

After many simulations with a random grid there is not an enormous difference between each separate simulation in numbers. Blocks and blinkers 
seem to be the configurations easiest to appear. Light-weight spaceships and toads seem to be the most difficult figures to form, because atleast
in 5 of my simulations the light-weightship never appeared.
